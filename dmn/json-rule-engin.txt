 rules define the conditions that need to be satisfied for a specific event to occur. They allow you to model decision-making logic and automate the process of evaluating conditions and triggering events based on those conditions.


 A rule consists of two main components: conditions and events.

Conditions:

Conditions define the criteria that must be met for the rule to be triggered.
They specify the facts, their paths, operators, and values to be compared.
Conditions can be simple or complex, depending on the logical operations used.
The json-rules-engine library supports logical operations such as "all" (AND), "any" (OR), and "not" (NOT).
The "all" condition requires that all sub-conditions within it evaluate to true for the rule to trigger.
The "any" condition requires that at least one sub-condition within it evaluates to true for the rule to trigger.
The "not" condition negates the result of a sub-condition.

Events:
Events define the actions or outcomes associated with a rule when its conditions are met.
They specify the type of event that will be triggered when the rule is evaluated as true.
Events can be used to indicate success, failure, or any other desired outcome.
By defining rules with appropriate conditions and events, you can model complex decision-making processes. The json-rules-engine library allows you to add rules to an engine, provide facts, and run the engine to evaluate the rules based on the provided facts.
